CSC2034-Topics in Computing-Games Engineering-Coursework-Unity  Newcastle University

This is a coursework project that I completed at the university. It was also my first Unity project as a game develooper. The aim of this project is to implement new game mechanisms base on the original code, such as physics, player movement, collision, enemy AI and emergent gameplay. The above PDF document outlines the features I implemented in this project. The gameplay of this project is a reference to Pac-Man. You can also view the result by the link below.
